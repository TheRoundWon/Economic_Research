Last weeks' earnings were concerning more due to the raise in CAPEX rather than a reduction in earnings - though that wasn't nice either. Hard to say how there is room for the stock to return for another quarter until there is some major headline with respect to management / strategy change that the market will positively absorb. Right now stocks seem at okay value since P/E is now lower than most tech stocks - but if they keep burning through cash is it low enough? Use anything close to 100 to sell your shares in my opinion.\n","    - Tesla shares are struggling to break 230 despite Elon selling pressure now clearly out of the market. I guess concerns are raised over the fact that Twitter and Tesla fates are becoming closely entwined. I personally still expect these stocks to lag the S&P so would sell if you can get to 230 or close to it. I expect them lower than 200 before end of the year.\n","    - Financials & Energy are probably top contenders for my picks still.

In 2006 we hit a high of ~5.25% in fed policy rates which translated to just below 5.2% in 2y and ~6.25% in 1y Treasury yields. JPM thinks yearend 10y rates are going to be 4.2 - 4.5/6 (upside).I agree with most Banks calls for signs of deceleration in hiking for future cycles but I think we need to see evidence that real rates are closer to +2% before the fed starts decelerating to 50bps. My guess is that real rates need to print at around +1-1.25% or signs of an impending strong Q4 contraction for Fed to start easing the gas here. \n","\n","* **FX** - USD is coming off the 3y highs as other currencies finally rally (namely EUR and GBP) though I expect that to end this week (and growth in other markets as a result). One last hawkish Fed should probably clear out any recent dollar shorts. This is EUR will probably continue to appreciate as demand for energy will probably be more severe there and put more cash demand. GBP will probably enjoy revival another couple weeks. I still like the long EURBRL trade - so far foriegn investors have been favorable to Lula but that just means to me that there should be more FX vol premium (because if foreigners get spoked they will exit positions to hard currency). With eur inflation so high,  I expected more hawkish policy to keep demand for EUR strong. I'm timidly thinking my em local index should start doing better here as I would imagine after a short term shake up demand for dollar needs to cool off or the Fed will face a new problem.\n","* **Credit** - No idea, wish I was in the bond market.

American Energy has had blockbuster year, will probably continue.\n","\n","\n","\n","* **Rates** -  [JP Morgan is calling for a 75bp hike in Nov follwed by 50bps in Dec to the Fed Policy Rate](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/at-any-rate/id1481423053?i=1000583872389) - seems reasonable to me unless there is a huge upset with GDP and sudden evidence of job market weakness.Hard to say without seeing what's trading directly, but if I had to guess given 1y at 4.60-4.70, 2y Treasuries are around 4.40-4.50 and 10y at 4.10 - 4.20 right now, unless we see a very low GDP (i.e. negative) it seems difficult for rates to stay below 4.5% if GDP and inflation remain strong. In 2006 we hit a high of ~5.25% in fed policy rates which translated to just below 5.2% in 2y and ~6.25% in 1y Treasury yields. JPM thinks yearend 10y rates are going to be 4.2 - 4.5/6 (upside). While I hunt for the data, I am guessing that Fed Dots also forecasted ~6.5% policy rates in the upcoming year only to be surprised by a much nastier than expected recession in 2008. Back in 2005, the economy also had an inverted inflation expectation curve (pretty similar to now) - given this data my guess is that \n","* **FX** - USD is coming off the 3y highs as other currencies finally rally (namely EUR and GBP). This is EUR will probably continue to appreciate as demand for energy will probably be more severe there and put more cash demand.GBP will probably get a \"glam up\" revive with Sunak returning for next few weeks.\n","* **Credit** - No idea, wish I was in the bond market. Gotta find more info.\n","* **Real Estate** - Property appears to be dropping like it's hot (especially in the SF Bay Area) - I expect this will need to continue for another 6 months atleast (finger in the air guess here from all the continues Tech layoff headlines and high interest rates). Expecting worst markets in SF and Seattle. After a recent visit to a red state, I have a funny feeling that red states are going to enjoy relatively better returns than blue states (eerily no homless, much cleaner streets, percieved cheaper living) which will probably attract migrants from blue states pushed by recession. Charts on this coming soon.\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<a id=population></a>\n","# US Population\n","    - Household estimates - TTLHHM156N\n","    - Total US population -

not reached the level of inversion seen since the 80s (sparked after period caused by the crash in [Black Monday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987))) suggesting that we are approaching a key pivot point. Black Monday is important (please click the 80s tab) because you will observe that the 10s20s vs 20s30s treasury relationship exhibited an important trading relationship commonly seen during distressed markets - when markets the distressed, people sell what is most liquid - not necessarily what is percieved to be most expensive on the curve. 20y has historically had less liquidity than the 10y (the flight to safety asset) and 30y (the mortgage hedge) so in a period of deep uncertainty when rates moved very quickly and there was a period of high systemic risk, it's important to note that 10s30s hardly moved as bonds were moving in a 300bp range.\n","\n","#### Assessment\n","\n","The curve is currently slightly inverted and can worsen in my opinion if the situation in Russia and Ukraine worsens, a new risk emerges with China and Taiwan tensions flaring or some natural disaster / geopolitical unforseen risk / biological risk somehow greatly upsets global trade barely forming repaired routes then curve can invert signifcantly more if this percieved as a near term risk. However, in event of a positive growth/inflation outcome (ie we see more reason for Fed thinking gdp hasn't been too affected by Rate Hikes in Q3 - they started in May so it would affect this quarter) I believe there can still be large hikes of 75bps in the horizon for Nov (otherwise I'd imagine they start easing the gas to 50bps).\n","\n","##### Key Risks\n","* If there is long term growth
